A program to examine your performance in a match or compare how your performance

Does it work?
=============

Look, this program isn't going to be useful yet. Don't even bother to download it.
It runs, parses replays (using Bruno's awesome parser), and shows some stats. But 
is still very much a work in-progress. Feel free to contribute!
